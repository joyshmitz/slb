## [Unreleased] -- changes on `main` since v0.2.0

Compare: [`v0.2.0...main`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/compare/v0.2.0...main)

### Pattern Matching

- **Fallback SQL DELETE detection for compound commands**: The pattern engine now detects dangerous `DELETE FROM` statements embedded inside compound commands (e.g., `psql -c "DELETE FROM users; DROP TABLE x;"`), closing a gap where SQL wrapped in shell commands could evade classification ([`c40b097`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c40b09758b21edd800a3b4ed0082cacf3d08bff9))

### Output Formats

- **TOON format support**: Token-efficient encoding via `tru`/`tr` binary for structured CLI output, reducing token consumption when agents consume `slb` output ([`d2154d9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/d2154d93694ddf7ac9688d59c2585b5827e3a7fe))

## [v0.2.0] -- 2026-01-13

**GitHub Release**: [`v0.2.0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (published 2026-01-14)
Compare: [`v0.1.0...v0.2.0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

This release adds Claude Code hook integration for automatic command interception, enables Homebrew and Scoop auto-publishing via GoReleaser, and resolves a batch of state machine, pattern matching, and hook bugs discovered during post-v0.1.0 stabilization.

### Claude Code Hook Integration

The major feature of this release: a complete `slb hook` subcommand suite that intercepts Bash tool calls before execution in Claude Code sessions.

- **Hook infrastructure**: `slb hook generate`, `install`, `uninstall`, `status`, `test` commands with a Python guard script (`~/.slb/hooks/slb_guard.py`) that classifies risk and communicates with the SLB daemon via Unix socket ([`39c2f87`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/39c2f87ff26843c2bc72c528cb3614a26efddb3c))
- Returns `allow`, `ask`, or `block` action to Claude Code based on risk tier
- Fail-closed: dangerous commands blocked when SLB daemon is unavailable

### Package Distribution

- **GoReleaser auto-publishing** to Homebrew (`brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/slb`) and Scoop (`scoop install dicklesworthstone/slb`) -- packages now auto-update on every release ([`995dd17`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/995dd17c3fbbe84363306b020cbc9288b869e1ef))
- GoReleaser config updated for v2 format (`folder` -> `directory`); Homebrew skipped temporarily until tap repo was ready ([`87db783`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/87db7832ac0b1f578de7a59efdb60d8d0b3850e0), [`8764edd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/8764eddb4b87f239441c5769ccb54589404a89c2))
- Claude Code `SKILL.md` added for automatic capability discovery ([`2926cda`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/2926cda2a0eee5b8bcceb0efddbfed070f5cae9a))

### Security

- **Compound command quote bypass vulnerability fixed**: Shell-aware splitting now correctly handles quoted separators, preventing commands like `echo ";" && rm -rf /` from being misclassified as safe ([`dffc948`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/dffc94866e3f0f2e04027fedea3de2167599638f))

### State Machine Fixes

- Transitions now prevent panics on short request IDs ([`ba4510d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/ba4510d9d089d5c5c74c72c4e8d02c94a911a842))
- Cancel command and `StatusEscalated` state transitions corrected ([`1476f11`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/1476f11d8fb5fb6d146acd3285e5fad09f316356))
- Escalated requests can now be reviewed (previously silently rejected) ([`00b213c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/00b213cfd1fec5d4d017b559d3bc0272f71515d6))

### Pattern Matching Fixes

- Compound command tier precedence corrected -- highest-risk segment now properly determines overall tier ([`7fd44d9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/7fd44d9c27bb341cba94f680ad4f51749fcdaaa4))
- `IsSafe` flag initialization corrected for compound command classification ([`036c75a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/036c75a6ca168dde2d74d2c8d05182c8af4177d6))
- `rm -fr` pattern bug resolved (previously only `rm -rf` was matched) ([`bb9f88a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/bb9f88a0e2729e59e88ba980c28760c9cc0d79a0))

### Execution Fixes

- `exit_code` and `duration` only set when command result is actually available, preventing nil dereferences ([`1c733e8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/1c733e899a5691aaa6754bdc37f5c1596874c48f))
- Edge cases in command truncation and event type mapping handled ([`8d48a9e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/8d48a9e607526240a830bfc36b6f2c8738804349))
- Missing `Execution`/`Rollback` parsing in `scanRequests` database query ([`bc94544`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/bc9454456117d2f3eb4f4ba81c9f5b64ffb8751c))

### Hook Fixes

- Corrected bounds check in `slb_guard.py` substring matching ([`24157ef`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/24157ef14ea75d3b741845c77703d89f5f8acdbc))
- Fixed Python hook daemon communication path ([`7268863`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/726886309201f60a41aeba225f7834a0c1830aa1))
- `hookTestCmd` validation and Python fallback caution handling corrected ([`571971e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/571971e324df1a99e4239a7f6d7ef7eb8265ceae))
- macOS test compatibility issues resolved ([`bb9f88a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/bb9f88a0e2729e59e88ba980c28760c9cc0d79a0))

## [v0.1.0] -- 2025-12-24

**GitHub Release**: [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (published 2025-12-25)

The initial public release of SLB, built from scratch in ~11 days (2025-12-13 to 2025-12-24) with 264 commits, comprehensive test coverage (80%+ CI threshold), and cross-platform binaries via GoReleaser.

### Command Classification Engine

The core of SLB: a shell-aware pattern matching engine that classifies commands into risk tiers before execution.

- **Four-tier risk classification**: CRITICAL (2+ approvals, never auto-approve), DANGEROUS (1 approval), CAUTION (auto-approve after 30s delay), SAFE (immediate, no review) ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- **Shell-aware normalization**: Strips wrapper prefixes (`sudo`, `doas`, `env`, `time`, `nohup`), extracts inner commands from `bash -c '...'`, resolves relative paths to absolute ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- **Compound command splitting**: Commands joined by `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|` are split and classified independently -- the highest-risk segment determines the overall tier ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- **Fail-safe parse handling**: Unparseable commands (unbalanced quotes, complex escapes) get their tier upgraded one level (SAFE -> CAUTION, CAUTION -> DANGEROUS, etc.) ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- **Runtime pattern management** via `slb patterns list|test|add` -- agents can add patterns but not remove them ([`a515b09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/a515b09bf9a0212263550ce0ac7ab5ec8f1cc45e))
- Critical patterns for disk destruction (`dd of=/dev/`) and system file changes added ([`b3dd913`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/b3dd913dc748a2afddb9fdc56a1b3a95f5277202))
- Edge case gaps in risk classification closed ([`1225afb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/1225afb9e33e3d331e0e2af57a8ea4b21a206215))

### Request Lifecycle & Execution

The complete workflow from requesting approval through execution and rollback.

- **`slb run`**: Atomic check-request-wait-execute pipeline -- the primary command for agents ([`a515b09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/a515b09bf9a0212263550ce0ac7ab5ec8f1cc45e))
- **Client-side execution**: Commands run in the calling process's shell environment, inheriting AWS credentials, kubeconfig, virtualenvs, SSH agents, database connection strings ([`71d5808`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/71d58088b945f3175560cb2d61f594cefd98415b))
- **Command hash binding**: SHA-256 hash computed at request time, verified before execution -- any modification after approval is rejected ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- **Five execution verification gates**: status check, approval expiry, command hash match, tier consistency, first-executor-wins atomicity ([`71d5808`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/71d58088b945f3175560cb2d61f594cefd98415b))
- **Dry run pre-flight** for supported commands: `terraform plan`, `kubectl diff`, `git diff` ([`d1e8bde`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/d1e8bde94d8d77bdafb219954149ef0ff114aad1))
- **Rollback state capture**: Filesystem tar archives, git state (HEAD, branch, dirty files), Kubernetes manifests captured before execution for potential rollback via `slb rollback` ([`d1e8bde`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/d1e8bde94d8d77bdafb219954149ef0ff114aad1))
- **Emergency override**: `slb emergency-execute` with mandatory reason, hash acknowledgment, and permanent audit record for true emergencies ([`a515b09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/a515b09bf9a0212263550ce0ac7ab5ec8f1cc45e))
- Request state machine with well-defined transitions: PENDING -> APPROVED/REJECTED/CANCELLED/TIMEOUT -> EXECUTING -> EXECUTED/EXEC_FAIL/TIMED_OUT ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
- Approval TTL enforcement: 30 minutes standard, 10 minutes for CRITICAL ([`c4561db`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/commit/c4561db89abebab1f24e7717b2276308e6e67aca))
